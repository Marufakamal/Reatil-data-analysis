# Housing-Price-Prediction
 Here I have used numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn , XGBRegressor for libraries for predicting  the accuracy  of the Housing price model. 
I have used the sklearn for importing the datasets.
Visualization graph has been used to show the prediction model accuracy
